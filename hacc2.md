    <h2>Competitive Programming</h2>
    <p>I'm guessing you are new to this. If you are wondering what Competitive Programming is, it's a way to test your coding skills along with your problem-solving by solving diverse problems and coming up with efficient solutions.</p>

    <h3>Prerequisites:</h3>
    <p>Basics of a programming language, preferably <strong>C++</strong> but any other mainstream language will do.</p>

    <p>If you are new to all this, read through the next section :3</p>

    <h3>Programming Environment</h3>
    <p>Firstly, you'll need a text editor. If you don't already have an editor of choice, I'll recommend <strong>VS Code</strong> as it is the most widely used code editor at present.</p>
    <p>It's pretty straightforward setting an environment for C++, a lot of tutorials exist on YouTube; you can follow any of those, but make sure that it's fairly recent.</p>

    <h2>Basics of Programming</h2>
    <p>Keep in mind that I'll be assuming that you are using C++ as your language of choice, if that's not the case, you can still keep up as the instructions are pretty much universal.</p>
    <p>Again, there are many ways to learn the basics of C++. <a href="https://www.learncpp.com">LearnCpp.com</a> is an excellent resource, similar to a wiki, that covers everything from absolute basics to advanced stuff about C++. However, I would not recommend using it as your sole guide.</p>
    <p>Choose any tutorial or source you like and learn about the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Basic Syntax</li>
        <li>Input/Output</li>
        <li>Arrays</li>
        <li>Loops</li>
        <li>Conditionals</li>
        <li>Functions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is the bare minimum you need to be able to write a working code in C++, and you should even be able to solve most of the basic problems using these.</p>
    <p>There's something called <strong>Standard Template Library (STL)</strong> in C++, which is unarguably the most important thing you need to know. The STL provides efficient, well-implemented data structures and algorithms.</p>
    <p>These are the containers that I would recommend you learn:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>vector</li>
        <li>string</li>
        <li>map</li>
        <li>set</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
        <p>P.S. If you are new to programming, I would recommend taking <a href="https://www.harvardonline.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science">CS50</a> (short for Computer Science 50), which is an introductory computer science course offered by Harvard University. Try it out for a bird's-eye view of a wide range of topics and to learn the fundamentals.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>On to the next part :3</p>

    <h2>CodeChef</h2>
    <p>There are many platforms for Competitive Programming, but we will be getting started with <a href="https://www.codechef.com/">CodeChef</a>, which is, in my opinion, the most beginner-friendly of them all.</p>

    <h3>Getting yourself registered</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Head over to <a href="https://www.codechef.com/">CodeChef</a> and make an account.</li>
        <li>After logging in, click on your avatar (in the top right) and go to 'Edit Profile'.</li>
        <li>In the 'Professional' section, specify that you are a student.</li>
        <li>Fill up the 'Where do you study?' section.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>I strongly suggest visiting the <a href="https://www.codechef.com/learn/course/cpp">Learn</a> section on CodeChef and going through the C++ beginner course to gain firsthand experience in problem-solving.</p>
