It is the basic process that a computer's CPU uses to rum instructions.

1. Fetch:
  In this step, the CPU retrieves the next instruction from memory. The program counter (PC), which keeps track of memory address of the next instruction to be executed, is incremented by the size of the current instruction so that it points to the next instruction in memory.

2. Decode:
   Once the instruction has been fetched, the CPU decodes it to determine what operation needs to be performed. This involves breaking down the instruction into its various components, such as the opcode (which specifies the operation to be performed) and any operands (which specify the data on which the operation should be performed).

3. Execute:
   Finally, the CPU performs the operation specified by the decoded instruction . This can involve reading and writing data to a memory, performing arithmetic or logical operations on data, or branching to a different part of the program based on some condition.

After completing the execute step, the cycle starts again with the fetch step for the next instruction in the memory. This process  continues until the program terminates or the CPU runs into an error.
