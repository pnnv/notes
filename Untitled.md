#### Competitive Programming
I am guessing you are new to this, if you are wondering what is Competitive Programming, it's a way to test your coding skills along with your problem-solving by solving diverse problems and coming up with efficient solutions.

##### Prerequisites: 
Basics of a programming language, preferably C++ but any other mainstream language will do.

If you are new to all this, read through the next section :3
##### Programming Environment
Firstly you'll need a text editor. If you don't already have an editor of choice, I'll recommend **VS Code** as it is the most widely used code editor at present.
It's pretty straightforward setting a environment for C++, buttload of tutorials exist on YouTube, you can follow any of those but make sure that it's fairly recent.

#### Basics of Programming
Keep in mind that I'll be assuming that you are using C++ as your language of choice, if that's not the case you can still keep up as the instructions are pretty much universal.

Again, there are many ways to learn the basics of C++. [LearnCpp.com](https://www.learncpp.com) is an excellent resource, similar to a wiki, that covers everything from absolute basics to advanced stuff about C++. However, I would not recommend using it as your sole guide.

Choose any tutorial or source you like and learn about the following:

- Basic Syntax
- Input/Output
- Arrays
- Loops
- Conditionals
- Functions

This is bare minimum you need to be able to write a working code in C++, you should even be able to solve most of the basic problems using these.

There's something called **Standard Template Library (STL)** in C++ which is unarguably the most important you need to know, The STL provides efficient, well-implemented data structures and algorithms.

These are the containers that I would recommend you learn:
- vector
- string
- map
- set

There are more containers which you can learn about but the ones listed above are the ones which are used the most.

> P.S. If you are new to programming, I would recommend taking [CS50](https://www.harvardonline.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science) (short for Computer Science 50), which is an introductory computer science course offered by Harvard University. Try it out for a bird's-eye view of a wide range of topics and to learn the fundamentals.
