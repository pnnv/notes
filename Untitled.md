#### Competitive Programming
I am guessing you are new to this, if you are wondering what is Competitive Programming, it's a way to test your coding skills along with your problem-solving by solving diverse problems and coming up with efficient solutions.

##### Prerequisites: 
Basics of a programming language, preferably C++ but any other mainstream language will do.

If you are new to all this, read through the next section :3

#### Basics of Programming
Keep in mind that I'll be assuming that you are using C++ as your language of choice, if that's not the case you can still keep up as the instructions are pretty much universal.

##### Programming Environment
Firstly you'll need a text editor. If you don't already have an editor of choice, I'll recommend **VS Code** as it is the most widely used code editor at present.
It's pretty straightforward setting a environment for C++, buttload of tutorials exist on YouTube, you can follow any of those but make sure that it's fairly recent.

Again, there are many ways through which you can learn basics of C++, [learncpp.com](https://www.learncpp.com) is an awesome resource, kind of like a wiki which contains everything from absolute basics to advanced stuff about C++. Though, I won't sugge
