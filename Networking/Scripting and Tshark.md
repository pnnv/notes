#### tshark
Even better than viewing packets in a GUI is playing with them in a scripting language. (tbh, wireshark is good for 99% of all usecases that don't involve insanely large pcaps).

tshark is a command line tool to do the same thing as [[Wireshark]] does, but all in Python. It allows us to script complex activities which we would never be able to do in wireshark.
