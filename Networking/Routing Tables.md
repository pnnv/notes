#### Routers
- A router is a networking device that forwards data packets between computer network. This device is usually connected to two or more different networks. When a data packet comes to a router port, the router reads the address information in the packet to determine out which port the packet will be sent.
  E.g. A  router provides you internet access by connecting your LAN with the internet.

- When a packet arrives at a Router, it examines destination IP address of a received packet and make routing decisions accordingly. Routers use **Routing Tables** to determine out which determines which interface the packet will be sent to.
