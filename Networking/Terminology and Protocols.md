Packets have a header portion that contains information about the packet including the source and destination, timestamps, network hops, etc. The main portion of the packet contains the actual data being transferred. It is sometimes called the body or the payload.

**Protocol**: A protocol is a set of rules and standards that define a language that devices can use to communicate. There are great number of protocols in use extensively in networking, and they are often implemented in different layers.

Some low level protocols are TCP, UDP, IP, and ICMP.
