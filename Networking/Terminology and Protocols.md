Packets have a header portion that contains information about the packet including the source and destination, timestamps, network hops, etc. The main portion of the packet contains the actual data being transferred. It is sometimes called the body or the payload.

**Protocol**: A protocol is a set of rules and standards that define a language that devices can use to communicate. There are great number of protocols in use extensively in networking, and they are often implemented in different layers.

Some low level protocols are TCP, UDP, IP, and ICMP. Some examples of application layer protocols, built on these protocols, are HTTP (for accessing web content), SSH, and TLS/SSL.

- Port: A port is an address on a single machine that can be tied to a single piece of software. It allows the server to be able to communicate using more than one application.
- Firewall: A firewall is a program that decides whether traffic coming or going from a server should be allowed. A firewall usually works by creating rules for which type of traffic is acceptable on which ports. Generally, firewalls block ports that are not used by a specific application on a server.
