Steganography is the practice of hiding data in plain sight. Steganography is often embedded in images or audio.

#### LSB Steganography

Files are made of bytes. Each byte is composed of eight bits.

Changing the least-significant bit (LSB) doesn't change the value very much.
So we can modify LSB without changing the file noticably. By doing so, we can hide a message inside.

*In images:*
The data is recorded in the least significant bit of a byte.
Decoding LSB steganography is exactly the same as encoding, but in reverse. For each byte, grab the LSB and add it to your decoded message. Once youâ€™ve gone through each byte, convert all the LSBs you grabbed into text or a file. (You can use your file signature knowledge here!)

For this challenge we are given `powpow.mp4`

#### MP4 Analysis
There are two main things to get out of this file:

```
$ exiftool powpow.mp4
...
Artist                          : Stefan Hetzl
Title                           : aHR0cDovL3N0ZWdoaWRlLnNvdXJjZWZvcmdlLm5ldC8=
...
```

Stefan Hetzl is the author of `StegHide`, and the base64 decodes to `http://steghide.sourceforge.net/`. This is usually used with JPEGs.

Now we use the `foremost` tool and we get a png.

#### PNG Analysis
`steghide` doesn't work with `PNG`s, so we have to keep looking. File carving doesn't get us anywhere here, so it must be something else. *The PNG format is ideal for lossless compression*, so we use stegsolve next.
We save the blue LSB plane because it looks sus.

```

looking at the stream of bits we can see how the encoding works.

```

|  FF  | |  D8  | |  FF  | |  E0  | |  00  | ...
```

There's just an extra bit placed after every encoded byte, so if we skip every 9th bit, when we convert binary to ascii, we should get the image.

It starts with `\xFF` which is what we'd want for a `jpeg`, but the rest is junk. The following python script:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
from PIL import Image
import sys

def b2a(b):
    s = ''
    while len(b) != 0:
        binbyte = b[:8]  # Get a byte
        s += chr(int(binbyte, 2)) # Convert it
        b = b[9:]  # Skip every 9th bit
    return s

# Load image data
img = Image.open(sys.argv[1])
w,h = img.size
pixels = img.load()

binary = ''
for y in xrange(h):
    for x in xrange(w):
        # Pull out the LSBs of this pixel in RGB order
        binary += ''.join([str(n & 1) for n in pixels[x, y]])
print b2a(binary)
```

```bash
$ ./lsb.py img1.png > img2.jpg
```

Voila! we get a jpg.

#### Using Steghide

So now we have a JPEG, but where's the password? Well, it's not there :( you can either run a dictionary attack or guess that the password is `password`.

```bash
$ steghide extract -sf img2.jpg -p password
wrote extracted data to "base64.txt".
$ cat base64.txt
W^7?+dsk&3VRB_4W^-?2X=QYIEFgDfAYpQ4AZBT9VQg%9AZBu9Wh@|fWgua4Wgup0ZeeU}c_3kTVQXa}eE
```

The encoded text is base85

```bash
$ python3
>>> import base64
>>> base64.b85decode('W^7?+dsk&3VRB_4W^-?2X=QYIEFgDfAYpQ4AZBT9VQg%9AZBu9Wh@|fWgua4Wgup0ZeeU}c_3kTVQXa}eE')
flag{We are fsociety, we are finally free, we are finally awake!}
```
