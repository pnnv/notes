A common scripting problem is connecting no web socket/SSH server and then doing some scripted activity. One critical tip to this is to spend some serious time trying to figure out everything the does (time out etc). Plenty of times you can just get good at whatever task needs to be scripted, or copy paste it into a different tool then back in, so you can avoid scripting altogether. But the lazy ways don't work every time.
