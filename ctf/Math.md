## Math

We don't need to know a lot of math, however, there are some things that are good to know outside of crypto.

#### Conditional Probability and Monty Hall

The *Monty Hall problem* is a brain teaser in the form of a probability puzzle.
- There are three doors, behind which are two goats and a car.
- You pick a door (call it door A). You're hoping to get the car.
- Monty Hall, the game show host, examines the other doors (B & C) and opens one with a goat. (if both have goats he picks randomly.)

The game is: *Do you stick with your choice or switch to the unopened door?*

**Solution:** The odds aren't 50-50. If you switch the doors you'll win 2/3 of the time.

#### Birthday Paradox

In probability theory, the **birthday problem** asks for the probability of that, in set of *n* randomly chosen people, at least two will share a birthday. The **birthday paradox** refers to the counter intuitive fact that *only 23 people are needed for that probability to exceed 50%.*

This result can be better understood by considering that the birthday comparisons will be made between every possible pair of individuals. With 23 individuals, there are 253 pairs to consider, far more than half the number of days in a year.

#### Compounding
>Compound Interest: The interest on a loan or deposit calculated based on both the initial principal and the accumulated interest from the previous periods.

- Compounding multiplies the money at an accelerated rate.
- Compounding interest is the interest calculated on the initial principal, which also includes all of the accumulated interest from previous periods.
- Generating "interest on interest" is known as the power of compound interest.
The formula for calculating compound interest is:

- **Compound interest** = total amount of principal and interest in future (or future value) minus principal amount at present (or present value)

> **= [P (1 + i)^n] – P**

> **= P [(1 + i)^n – 1]**

Where:

> P = principal

> i = annual interest rate

> n = number of compounding periods

As an example, take a 3-year loan of $10,000 at an interest rate of 5%, compounding annually. What would be the amount of interest? In this case, it would be:

> $10,000 [(1 + 0.05)^3 – 1] = $10,000 [1.157625 – 1] = $1,576.25


#### Amdahl's law

Amdahl's Law is a formula which gives the theoretical speedup in latency of the execution of a task at fixed workload that can be expected from a system whose resources are improved. It states that the "overall performance gained by optimising a single part of a system is limited by the fraction of the time that improved part is actually used". 
It is often used in parallel computing to predict the theoretical speedup when using multiple processors.

#### Curse of Dimensionality

The curse of dimensionality refers to various phenomena that arise when analyzing and organizing data in high-dimensional spaces that do not occur in low-dimensional settings such as the three-dimensional space of everyday experience. The expression was coined by Richard E. Ballman when considering problems in dynamic programming.
The common theme of these problems is that when the dimensionality increases, the volume of the space increases so fast that the available data becomes sparse. In order to obtain a reliable result, the amount of data needed often grows with dimensionality. Also, organizing and searching data often relies on detecting areas where objects form groups with similar properties; in high dimensional data, however, all objects appear to be sparse and dissimilar in many ways, which prevents common data organization strategies from being efficient. 

#### Survivorship Bias

It is the logical error of concentrating on entities that passed a selection process while overlooking that did not. This can lead to incorrect conclusions because of incomplete data.

Another kind of survivorship bias would involve thinking that an incident was not all that dangerous because the only people who were involved in the incident who can speak about it are those who survived it. Even if one knew that some people are dead, they would not have their voice to add to the conversation, leading to bias in the conversation.
